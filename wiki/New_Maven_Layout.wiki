#Describe how to build from the new maven layout

= Introduction =

I've tried to make of more maven friendly layout for the project. I hope this will help in futur developpement and make build easier.


= Details =

First, on your local pc make a directory where you will get the two parts of the projets. Let's call it _wicket-ext-all_.

Go in _wicket-ext-all_ and make the two commands :
  * svn co http://wicket-ext.googlecode.com/svn/branches/newMavenLayout wicket-ext
  * svn co http://wicket-ext-bundle.googlecode.com/svn/branches/newMavenLayout wicket-ext-bundle

_(Name of the wicket-ext-bundle directory is very important, don't change it)_.

_(Of course if you have rigths to write use https instead of the readonly http)_.



This will create the two directories for the two parts of the project. Now you can go inside wicket-ext and make a simple _mvn clean install_ . Everything is building and testing ! _(wicket-ext-bundle is view as a module from wicket-ext)_ . 

To create all files needed by eclipse juste do a _mvn eclipse:clean eclipse:m2eclipse_ from the same place.

To launch examples, go into wicket-ext-examples and make a _mvn jetty:run-exploded_, it works like a charm :).

Well, more of that, the pom.xml of wicket-ext-superpom has all properties that define wich version of wicket is used and so on. 

= Using wicket-ext in a project =

Now to use wicket-ext in a maven project, using transitive dependencies, simply add:

{{{
<dependency>
  <groupId>${project.groupId}</groupId>
  <artifactId>wicket-ext-bundle</artifactId>
  <version>${project.version}</version>
</dependency>
}}} 

here for the moment ${project.version} is 0.6.1-newMavenLayout-SNAPSHOT.

This is surely not perfect for the moment, I'm waiting formyour comments ;)
